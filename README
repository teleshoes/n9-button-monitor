2. About
--------
N9 Button Monitor is toggleable daemon for Nokia N9/N950 that monitors
hardware buttons and performs certain actions (defined in ini file) on clicks.

Actions are performed conditionally based on type of click (single, double,
etc.) and context (certain app is launched, screen is locked, etc.).

It is written in python.

3. Where to get
---------------
	https://github.com/teleshoes/n9-button-monitor

4. Usage
--------
Install the .deb on your device (don't forget to allow installation from
non-Store sources in the Settings). As usual an icon will be placed on your
homescreen. Click it and it will turn red - the daemon is now running and
monitoring buttons. Click it once more and the icon will revert back to green,
which means that daemon is now stopped.

By default N9 Button Monitor is using built-in config (you can find it in
config.py file) that supports the following things:

	- Controlling default music player from lockscreen using Volume Up/Down
	- Taking pictures (and focusing) with default camera app using Volume Up
	- Taking pictures with 'Front Camera N9 (video+)' using Volume Up
	- Taking pictures with 'rawcam' using Volume Up
	- Focusing with proximity sensor in default camera app

You can create custom config file (where you can change button actions and some
general settings) that application will use instead of built-in config. Place
it here:

	/home/user/.config/n9-button-monitor.ini
	
Example config (n9-button-monitor.ini), which also highlights other features
and capabilities of N9 Button Monitor, is included with the sources. 

5. Building
-----------
The easiest way to build N9 Button Monitor is by using MeeGo 1.2
Harmattan Platform SDK provided by Nokia. Just make sure that you have
installed Platform SDK correctly, start scratchbox, select HARMATTAN_ARMEL
target, switch to sources directory and type:

	dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

You can also use other means of building .deb packages (e.g. PySide Assistant
or PyPackager) but they are not supported by the current distribution.
