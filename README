2. About
--------
N9 Button Monitor is a daemon for Nokia N9/N950 that monitors
hardware buttons and performs certain actions (defined in ini file) on clicks.

Actions are performed conditionally based on type of click (single, double,
etc.) and context (certain app is launched, screen is locked, etc.).

There is a separate package for adding a toggle to the status menu.

3. Download
---------------
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/n9buttonmonitor/files/

4. Usage
--------
Install the .deb on your device (don't forget to allow installation from
non-Store sources in the Settings). 

It is automatically started at boot, and by default adds torch and music player
controls to the lockscreen, and makes the Vol+ button a physical camera button
in the camera app.

There is a user interface for adding/removing actions and conditions, but its
easier to just edit the config file, which is located here:

	/home/user/.config/n9-button-monitor.ini

5. Building
-----------
The easiest way to build N9 Button Monitor is by using MeeGo 1.2
Harmattan Platform SDK provided by Nokia. See instructions from Nokia on how to
install scratchbox and the SDK. Start scratchbox, select HARMATTAN_ARMEL
target, and run dpkg-buildpackage.
